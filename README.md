## Course Overview

This repository is designed for learning C programming. It covers the following topics:

- Introduction to C programming
- Variables, data types, and operators
- Control structures (if, loops, switch)
- Functions
- Arrays
- Pointers
- Structures
- File I/O
- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Linked Lists
- Recursion
- Advanced topics (e.g., bitwise operations, multi-threading)

Each section includes code examples with detailed explanations and exercises to test your knowledge.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have the following:

- A basic understanding of how computers work
- Basic knowledge of mathematics
- A text editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang) installed on your machine

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/c-language-course.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

    ```bash
    cd c-language-course
    ```

3. Compile the C code examples (for example, `hello_world.c`):

    ```bash
    gcc hello_world.c -o hello_world
    ```

4. Run the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./hello_world
    ```

## Code Examples

Hereâ€™s an example of how to get started with your C programming journey:

### 1. Hello World (hello_world.c)

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

#### Running the example:
1. Open the `hello_world.c` file.
2. Compile using `gcc hello_world.c -o hello_world`.
3. Run the program with `./hello_world`.

---

### 2. Variables and Data Types (variables.c)

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int age = 25;
    float height = 5.9;
    char grade = 'A';

    printf("Age: %d\n", age);
    printf("Height: %.2f\n", height);
    printf("Grade: %c\n", grade);

    return 0;
}
```

## Exercises

After going through each section, practice with these exercises:

1. **Write a program that prints your name.**
2. **Create a program that accepts two numbers and prints their sum.**
3. **Implement a program using loops that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to 100.**
4. **Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion.**
